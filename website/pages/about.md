Publishing is in a weird state of affairs.

On one hand it has never been easier to create content and reach a global audience from your bedroom, but, on the other hand, you have to choose between centralized platforms that don't have your best interest in mind, and actually treat you as livestock, or you need deep technical expertise to setup a website and then endure endless pain: a poor text editor experience, expensive newsletter management services and this is before talking about analytics, GDPR, SEO, hackers and hostiles bots.

There has to be a better way!

I published my [first blog post in 2013](https://kerkour.com/introduction-au-reverse-engineering-android). After a long period of inactivity, I then started to publish almost weekly. Since then, my life has never been the same.

I can't recount how many great things I have learned from readers and how many job offers I have received.

All of that wouldn't have been possible without Markdown. Markdown allowed me to focus on my writings instead on wasting countless hours configuring, and re-configuring software to publish my website, and copy-pasting content between my favorite word processor and the publishing software.

Unfortunately, publishing in Markdown was painful: you had to use static site editor, then find a hosting provider that won't bankrupt you if your website becomes mildly successful and finally write HTML by yourself to get a decent theme.

Just for the website part.

Then you had to pay for analytics and a newsletter service that charges you per number of contacts, even if you don't send any newsletter for a months because you have nothing interesting to say.

This is why I built Markdown Ninja.

Markdown Ninja is an all-in-one platform that takes care of all the technical details so you can focus your on creating great content: transforming Markdown into websites and newsletters, optimized for SEO, assets distribution, built-in, private-by-design and GDPR compliant analytics and many more great things are coming.

All of that from the coziness of your favorite editor, whether you prefer to write on an computer, a tablet or even a phone.


The best thing, you are asking? [Markdown Ninja is Open Source](https://github.com/bloom42/markdown-ninja). We are huge believer in sustainability, whether it be in our physical or digital world, and Markdown and Open Source are both the best ways to achieve a sustainable web and a sustainable world.
